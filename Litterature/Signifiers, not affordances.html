  <section class="post-full-content">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This was published in ACM <em>Interactions, volume 15, issue 6</em>.</p><p>It
 is time for a review. As time and technologies change, as we have moved
 from individual to group, social, and even cultural computing, and as 
the communication technologies have become as important as the 
computational ones, how well have our design principles kept up?</p><p>One
 of our fundamental principles is that of perceived affordances: that's 
one way we know what to do in novel situations. That's fine for objects,
 but what about situations? What about people, social groups, cultures? 
The answer is the same, yet different. Yes, there are still perceived 
affordances, constraints, and conceptual models, but there is more. 
There are trails. There are behaviors. We know how to behave by watching
 the behavior of others, or if others are not there, by the trails they 
have left behind. As we move from the world of stand-alone objects to 
social structures, complex, intelligent products, and a heavy dominance 
of services, then new principles are needed.</p><p>Powerful clues arise 
from what I call social signifiers. A "signifier" is some sort of 
indicator, some signal in the physical or social world that can be 
interpreted meaningfully. Signifiers signify critical information, even 
if the signifier itself is an accidental byproduct of the world. Social 
signifiers are those that are relevant to social usages. Some social 
indicators simply are the unintended but informative result of the 
behavior of others. Let me illustrate.</p><p>Suppose you are rushing to 
catch a train. You know the train was scheduled to depart soon. You run 
across the city, run up the stairs in the train station and rush on to 
the platform. There is no train: did you miss it, or perhaps has it 
simply not arrived yet? How can you tell? The state of the platform 
serves as an signifier. People milling about the platform? The train has
 not arrived. An empty platform: oops, you missed it. This is an example
 of an incidental, accidental signifier. It isn't completely reliable, 
working better in small towns with only occasional trains than in 
crowded cities where many trains use the same platforms, but that is the
 nature of signifiers: often useful, but of mixed reliability.</p><p>Social
 signifiers, such as the presence or absence of people on a train 
platform, painted lines on the street, the trails that signal shortcuts 
through parks or across planted areas are examples of signaling systems.
 Signals come in many forms, sometimes naturally evolved, sometimes 
conventions of culture. Cues carry evidence, sometimes completely 
unintentional, as in the emptiness of the train platform. A flag's 
fluttering in the wind is a clue to wind direction and speed, usually 
unintentional, but nonetheless useful evidence to the observer. 
Sometimes the evidence is a trail or trace of previous behavior: desire 
lines, these are called in architecture and city planning, when the 
trails made by people's footsteps across fields indicates their desire 
for paved paths.</p><p>I call any physically perceivable cue a 
signifier, whether it is incidental or deliberate. A social signifier is
 one that is either created or interpreted by people or society, 
signifying social activity or appropriate social behavior. Thus, 
although there are many possible signifiers of wind speed and direction,
 including flags, the movement of grasses or tree leaves, or traveling 
debris, if the signifier is a flag, it is also a social signifier, for 
it had to be placed in its location by people, presumably for a reason 
(which may have nothing to do with providing an indication of the wind).</p><p>Signifiers, Not Affordances</p><p>The
 concept of "affordance" has captured the imagination of designers. The 
term was originally invented by the perceptual psychologist J. J. Gibson
 to refer to a relationship: the actions possible by a specific agent on
 a specific environment. To Gibson, affordances did not have to be 
perceivable or even knowable -- they simply existed. When I introduced 
the term into design in 1988 I was referring to perceivable affordances.
 Since then, the term has been widely used and misused. The result has 
been confusions and a goldmine for academic scholars who get to write 
learned articles about the true meaning of the term.</p><p>People need 
some way of understanding the product or service, some sign of what it 
is for, what is happening, and what the alternative actions are. People 
search for clues, for any sign that might help them cope and understand.
 It is the sign that is importance, anything that might signify 
meaningful information. Designers need to provide these clues. Forget 
affordances: what people need, and what design must provide, are 
signifiers. Because most actions we do are social, the most important 
class of these are social signifiers.</p><p>We are all detectives, 
searching for clues to enable us to function in this complex world. 
Whether it is flags waving in the wind, the difference between empty or 
crowded train platforms, or the desire lines illustrated by footprints 
in the fields that suggest paths to follow, we search for significant 
signs in the world that offer guidance. In the social world comprised of
 people and technology, these cues are social signifiers.</p><p>Consider
 a bookmark, a deliberately placed signifier of one's place in reading a
 book. But the physical nature of books also make them an accidental 
social signifier, for the placement of the bookmark tells the reader how
 much of the story remains. Most readers have learned to use this 
accidental signifier to aid in their enjoyment of the reading. With few 
pages left, we know the end is near. And if the reading is torturous, as
 in a school assignment, one can always console oneself by knowing "only
 a few more pages to get through." Electronic book readers do not have 
the physical structure of paper books, so unless the designer 
deliberately provides a cue, they need not convey any signal at all 
about the amount of text remaining. The traditional browser on the 
computer screen provides a deliberate social signifier, with the 
position of the scrollbar showing how much more of the document remains 
and its length showing what proportion is visible at the moment. Hill, 
Hollan, Wroblewski and McCandless's addition of usage marks - edit wear 
and read wear - is yet another clever way for designers to add 
signifiers to guide readers of electronic documents (Hill, Hollan, 
Wroblewski, &amp; McCandless, 1992).</p><p>The signifier is an important
 communication device to the recipient, whether or not communication was
 intended. From the purpose of surviving in the world, it doesn't matter
 to an individual whether the useful signal was deliberately placed 
there or whether it is incidental: to the recipient, there is no 
necessary distinction. Why should it matter whether the flag was placed 
as a deliberate clue to wind direction (as is done at airports or on the
 masts of sailboats) or whether it was there as an advertisement or 
symbol of pride in one's country (as is done on public buildings): once I
 interpret the flag's motion to indicate wind direction, it does not 
matter why it was placed there.</p><p>Whatever their nature, planned or 
accidental, signifiers provide valuable cues as to the nature of the 
world and of social activities. For us to function in this social, 
technological world, we need to develop internal models of what things 
mean, of how they operate. We seek all the cues we can find to help in 
this enterprise, and in this way, we all act as detectives, searching 
for whatever guidance we might find. If we are fortunate, thoughtful 
designers provide the clues for us. Otherwise, we must use our 
creativity and imagination. (This is the premise behind Distributed 
Cognition: see (Hollan, Hutchins, &amp; Kirsh, 2000).</p><p>Social 
signifiers replace affordances, for they are broader and richer, 
allowing for accidental signifiers as well as deliberate ones, and even 
for items that signify by their absence, as the lack of crowds on a 
train platform. The perceivable part of an affordance is a signifier, 
and if deliberately placed by a designer, it is a social signifier.</p><p>Designers of the world: Forget affordances provide signifiers.</p><blockquote>Don
 Norman wears many hats, including co-founder of the Nielsen Norman 
group, Professor at Northwestern University, and author. It should not 
come as a surprise to learn that social signifiers play a major role in 
his new book, tentatively entitled "Sociable design." He lives at
